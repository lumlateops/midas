 hi swasti,thank you for registering with quibids, a revolutionary, fast-paced auction site. first, we wanted to see if we could assist you by answering any questions you might have about our site. we truly believe that you will notice the great deals our site has to offer once you start using it!how quibids works:each bid costs just $0.60. bids are available in bid packs of 40, 75, 300, 600 and 800 bids. these bids are pre-paid and placed in your bids account. each time you place a bid, one bid is deducted from your bids account, and a maximum of 20 seconds is added to the timer each time someone bids. this gives enough time for someone else to make the decision to bid if they're interested. this is similar to the “going once...twice...sold” approach of auctions. if you are the top bidder when the timer reaches zero, you win!  you then pay the ending auction price plus shipping.  if you do not win, you lose your bids that have been placed; however, we offer on most auctions a "buy it now" feature! this feature allows you to put the money spent in bids on the item towards buying the item.  an example is illustrated below: let's say you spend 30 bids trying to win a $30 product, but you don't win it. your 30 bids are worth $18, so if you exercised the "buy it now" for that item, you would pay the value price of $30 less the $18 in bids you spent trying to win the item. thus, you could go ahead and buy the item for just $12 in this example. this feature limits the risk in participating in our auctions as we offer the "buy it now" feature for the majority of our auctions! confirm your accountplease visit https://www.quibids.com/account/account_confirm.php?id=674074  to confirm your e-mail address within the next 24 hours. an additional e-mail has been sent to you with the same code in case you miss it here! additional questions or comments?if you still have questions about our website, don't hesitate to contact our support by writing us at support@quibids.com. our goal is for every registrant to be well informed and to have the best possible chance at winning an awesome deal, so don't hesitate to write us! sincerely, quibids staff support@quibids.com home | quibids101 | support | about us | terms & conditions | privacy policy quibids holdings llc | 4 ne 10th, suite 242 | oklahoma city, ok 73104-1402 note: quibids will never ask you for your password in an email or over the phone bid safely on quibids | © copyright all rights reserved.
